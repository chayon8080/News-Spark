        Question 03: Why we use template string?
    </h1>
    <h3>
        Answer :
        template: Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us
        insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older versions
        of
        JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements. Another great thing
        that
        comes with template strings are tags. Tags are functions that take a string and the decomposed parts of the
        string
        as parameters and are great for converting strings to different entities.
